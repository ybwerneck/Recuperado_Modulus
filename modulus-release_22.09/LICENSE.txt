NVIDIA MODULUS LICENSE

This license is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs the use of the NVIDIA Modulus software and materials, as available from time to time, which may include software, models, helm charts and other content (collectively referred to as “Modulus Deliverables”).  The Modulus Deliverables may be delivered by NVIDIA in a container (each, a “CONTAINER”) or other form.
This license can be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in the country in which the Modulus Deliverables are used. If you are under the legal age of majority, you must ask your parent or legal guardian to consent to this license. If you are entering this license on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have legal authority and “you” will mean the entity you represent. 
By using the Modulus Deliverables, you affirm that you have reached the legal age of majority, you accept the terms of this license, and you take legal and financial responsibility for the actions of your permitted users. 

You agree to use the Modulus Deliverables only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this license, and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions.

1. LICENSE. Subject to the terms of this license, NVIDIA hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this license) to:
