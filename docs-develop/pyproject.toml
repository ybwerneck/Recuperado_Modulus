description = "NVIDIA Modulus is a neural network framework that blends the power of physics in the form of governing partial differential equations (PDEs) with data to build high-fidelity, parameterized surrogate models with near-real-time latency. Whether youâ€™re looking to get started with AI-driven physics problems or designing digital twin models for complex non-linear, multi-physics systems, NVIDIA Modulus can support your work."
